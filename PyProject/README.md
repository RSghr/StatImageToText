STATS TO TEXT

Just launch MainProgram.py and it will create the slices, and text in each attendee folder (attendee 0 is the host)

It's still being tuned.

Deploy 1 2 and 3 in order to get more testing data.

Archive is just old stuff or files I'd like to keep for now and delete later.

I have to write a whole setup with the pip commands and such.

you need to get ocr_env in your project.

MAINPROGRAM :
It takes as input the image path ==> Img_Path
First ImageSetup will generate all the images in Silces folder
They will be processed by ImageToText into the other folders
