STATS TO TEXT

You need to launch Deploy_Manager.py, it will go over the MASS_DEPLOY folder, make sure all the images have the correct name template as well as resolution.

It will create a new folder that separates each deployment and go over each one through the same process as before (attendee 0 is the host)

So far : 10 deployments in 15min

It's still being tuned.

Deploy 1 2 and 3 in order to get more testing data.

Archive is just old stuff or files I'd like to keep for now and delete later.

I have to write a whole setup with the pip commands and such.

you need to get ocr_env in your project.
